## Introduction

I am dedicating 6+ hours daily to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and 3 hours to other topics, with a total preparation time of 180 days. This repository contains my notes, resources, and solved questions to help me stay organized and consistent.

## Preparation Strategy

- **Consistency**: Consistency is key to achieving my dream and success.
- **Rotating Study Schedule**: I prefer a rotating study schedule to keep things fresh and cover all topics thoroughly.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The goal is to have thorough coverage of all topics relevant to a Senior Software Engineer interview at FAANG-level companies.
