### Notes
1. DynamoDB is much more similar to a Redis than it is to a MySQL. But, unlike Redis, it is immediately consistent and highly-durable, centered around that single data structure. If you put something into DynamoDB, youâ€™ll be able to read it back immediately and, for all practical purposes, you can assume that what you have put will never get lost.
